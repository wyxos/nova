## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted Streaming**: Your media, on your terms, with privacy at the forefront.
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Available for various desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Intuitive Media Library**: Effortlessly organize and manage your media collections.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The NOVA app is available as a packaged application for desktop platforms. Here's how to get started:

1. Download the latest version of NOVA from the [releases](https://github.com/wyxos/nova/releases) section.
2. Unpack the downloaded file and run the installer on your desktop.

### Accessing on Mobile

To access NOVA on your mobile device, you need to perform a few additional steps:

1. Launch NOVA on your desktop and navigate to the settings.
2. Configure the IP address and port for the server within the app's settings. This will allow your mobile device to
   connect to the desktop app over your local network.
3. Ensure the configured port is open in your Windows firewall and router settings. This step is crucial for enabling
   access from your mobile device.
4. If your IP address is dynamic (changes regularly), you may need to update these settings frequently. Alternatively,
   consider using a dynamic DNS service like No-IP to maintain a consistent domain name for your desktop app.

Once set up, enter the provided IP address and port in your mobile device's web browser to access NOVA.

### Usage

After installation, launch NOVA, navigate to the Settings screen (bottom cog icon) and add the folder where
your audio/video files are located. It will take a moment to index them all.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

NOVA supports a range of keyboard shortcuts to enhance your music listening experience, making it easier to control playback and rate your music without interrupting your workflow. Here are the shortcuts available:

### Rating Tracks

- **Rate a track**: Use `Alt + [1-5]` to rate the current track, where `1` is the lowest rating and `5` is the highest.

### Media Controls

- **Play/Pause**: `MediaPlayPause` toggles play/pause for the current track.
- **Next Track**: `MediaNextTrack` skips to the next track in your playlist.
- **Previous Track**: `MediaPreviousTrack` goes back to the previous track.

Ensure NOVA is focused or running in the background for these shortcuts to work effectively. These shortcuts are designed to integrate seamlessly with your media keys, providing you with quick access to NOVA's features directly from your keyboard.
